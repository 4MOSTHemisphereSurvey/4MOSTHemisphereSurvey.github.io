    4HS will obtain spectra and redshifts for ~6 million galaxies with high and 
    unbiased completeness across the full southern hemisphere, to define the 
    benchmark reference sample of galaxies at z < 0.15. The result is a dataset with 
    exceptional legacy value with wide applicability. As examples: 4HS will provide 
    the z~0 anchor for evolutionary studies with WAVES; the critical field sample 
    for cluster surveys like CHANCES; and the mass-limited comparison sample for HI 
    or X-ray selected samples from WALLABY or eROSITA. In combination with other 
    flagship surveys including VRO-LSST, VHS, WISE, Euclid, ASKAP/MeerKAT/SKA, 4HS 
    will establish a transformative laboratory for studying the baryon cycle within 
    and around galaxies as a function of galaxy/halo mass, as well as 
    local/large-scale environment. At the same time, 4HS cosmology will measure the 
    cosmic velocity field over ~1 Gpc from the peculiar velocities of ~500,000 
    massive early type galaxies. By mapping mass and motion on the largest possible 
    scales, 4HS will reveal a complete picture of gravitational collapse and cosmic 
    structure formation in the Local Volume.
