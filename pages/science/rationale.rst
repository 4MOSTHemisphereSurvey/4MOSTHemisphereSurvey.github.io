Scientific Rationale
====================

The 4MOST Hemisphere Survey (4HS) is designed to deliver the best possible description of galaxies in the :math:`z < 0.15` Universe, focusing on science applications that absolutely require spectroscopic (cf. photometric) redshifts. The 4HS galaxy sample is NIR-flux limited (:math:`J^\mathrm{AB} < 17`) as a close approximation to a stellar mass selection (volume limited for :math:`\log M_\star > 9.3,10.0,10.3` and :math:`z < 0.05,0.10,0.15`), and NIR colour-selected (:math:`(J - K)^\mathrm{AB} < 0.45`) to preselect galaxies to :math:`z \sim 0.3` and with near-total completeness for >2.5 M galaxies in the z < 0.15 interval. Our mean target density is :math:`\sim325 / \mathrm{deg}^2` and, for the reasons given below, we aim to survey the widest possible area: our goal is ~5.8 M galaxies over :math:`17.000+ \mathrm{deg}^2`. As a participating survey within 4MOST, 4HS can obtain high spectroscopic completeness with minimal bias as a function of local target density (cf. ‘fibre collisions’ in SDSS; DESI). The overarching goal of 4HS is to produce a comprehensive census of galaxies in the local Universe, with broad and lasting scientific impact for the fields of both cosmology and galaxy evolution, strong synergies with the broader 4MOST project, and exceptional legacy value for science with flagship Southern and European facilities — particularly LSST, Euclid, and SKA.
